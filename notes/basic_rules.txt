Army:
- Collection of models under player's command.

Units:
- Unit: A group of models from the same datasheet.
- Friendly models = all models in the same army.
- Enemy models = all models in your opponent’s army.
- Friendly units = all units in the same army.
- Enemy units = all units in opponent’s army.

Unit_Coherency:
- Unit coherency: 2" horizontally + 5" vertically.
- Each model must be in unit coherency with one other model from own unit.
- While unit has 6+ models, each model must be in unit coherency with 2
  other models from own unit.

Engagement_Range:
- Engagement Range: 1" horizontally + 5" vertically.
- Models cannot be set up within Engagement Range of enemy models.

Measuring_Distances:
- Distances measured in inches (").
- Always measure closest distance between bases (or hulls).
- Hull = Any part of a model that does not have a base. Can measure distances
  whenever you want.
- If several units tied for closest, player resolving the rule selects which
  is closest.

Within_And_Wholly_Within:
- Model within = any part of model’s base (or hull). 
- Model wholly within = every part of model’s base (or hull).
- Unit within = any model within.
- Unit wholly within = every model wholly within.

Dice:
- D6 = A six-sided dice.
- D3 = D6 divided by 2 (rounding up).
- All modifiers cumulative.
- Apply modifiers in the following order: division, multiplication, addition,
  then subtraction.
- Round fractions up after all modifiers have been applied. Dice roll cannot
  be modified to less than 1.

Re-Rolls:
- Re-roll: Roll dice again.
- Re-rolls are applied before modifiers (if any).
- A dice can never be re-rolled more than once. Unmodified dice: Result of
  roll after re-rolls, but before modifiers (if any).

Roll-Offs:
- Roll-off: Both players roll a D6 – highest wins.
- Roll again if a tie.

Sequencing:
If several rules must be resolved at the same time, the player whose turn
  it is chooses the order to resolve them.

Starting_Strength,_Half-Strength_And_Destroyed_Units:
- Starting Strength: Number of models in unit when it is added to your army.
- When a model is destroyed, remove it from
  the battlefield.
- Below Half-strength: Number of models in unit is less than half its Starting
  Strength.
- When the last model in a unit is destroyed, the unit is said to be destroyed.
