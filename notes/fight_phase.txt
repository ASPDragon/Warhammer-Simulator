- Starting with your opponent, alternate selecting units to fight with.
- When a unit fights, it piles in, then it makes close combat attacks,
  then it consolidates.
- If one player has no more units left to fight with, their opponent
  then fights with their remaining units, one at time.
- Once all units have fought, progress to the Morale phase.
