Morale_Tests:
- Players alternate taking Morale tests for units from their army
  that have suffered casualties this turn.
- If one player has no more units left to take Morale tests, their
  opponent then takes Morale tests for their remaining units, one at
  a time.
- Once all units have taken Morale tests, progress to the Unit
  Coherency Checks step.

Morale_Tests:
- Morale test = D6 + number of models destroyed this turn.
- Unmodified roll of 1 always a success (no models flee).
- If Morale test exceeds unit's Ld, one model flees and other models
  must take Combat Attrition tests.

Combat_Attrition_Tests:
- Combat Attrition tests: Roll one D6 for each remaining model in unit;
  for each 1 one additional model flees.
- Substract 1 from Combat Attrition tests if unit is below Half-strength.

Unit_Coherency_Checks:
- Remove models from units in your army that are not in unit coherency.
- Once all out of coherency models have been removed (if any), the Morale
  phase ends.
- The player's turn then ends and, unless the battle ends, the next player's
  turn begins.
